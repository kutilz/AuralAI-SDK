# ─── Non-speech chimes (synthesized offline, no network/gTTS) ─────────────
# These are the device's only non-verbal voice, and the first version made it
# sound broken rather than responsive: constant-amplitude sine bursts, butt-
# joined, each note ramping down to silence before the next ramped up. A flat
# sine held at full level for 90 ms is exactly the waveform cheap electronics
# use to say "fault", and the seam between segments read as a stutter — the
# device sounded like it was glitching, not acknowledging.
#
# What makes a tone read as a CHIME instead of a BEEP:
#   1. Percussive envelope. A struck object is loud for a few ms and then decays
#      — a high crest factor. A flat envelope has none, and the ear files it
#      under "alarm". Every note here is fast attack + exponential ring-out.
#   2. Overlap, not concatenation. Notes sit on a timeline and are MIXED, so a
#      note is still ringing when the next is struck. That is what turns three
#      pitches into a chord instead of three separate bleeps.
#   3. Partials. A pure sine is a test tone. A few decaying overtones above the
#      fundamental (each dying faster than the one below it, as in a real bar or
#      bell) give the warmth that makes it sound like an object, not a circuit.
#   4. Register. The device speaker is a tiny driver with nothing below ~500 Hz;
#      the old error cue's 440->330 Hz fell straight into that hole and came out
#      as a buzz. Everything now sits in 780-1900 Hz, where it is both efficient
#      and easy to hear over street noise.
