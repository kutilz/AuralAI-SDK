AuralAI SDK — Entry Point
Run on MaixCAM via MaixVision or: python main.py

Threads:
  AILoop        — camera → NPU inference → audio queue
  WebServer     — HTTP dashboard + API
  Watchdog      — module health monitor (restarts crashed components)
  HealthMonitor — hardware telemetry → adaptive power governor
  BtnListener   — GPIO mode-cycle button (if configured)

Boot-time optimization (2025-06-23)
────────────────────────────────────
The original code imported ALL modules at the top of the file before main()
could even start. On the MaixCAM RISC-V this import chain takes ~6.7 seconds
(config: 2s, cloud: 2.5s, web_server: 0.8s, …). The boot chime could not
play until after those imports completed.

Fix: only import stdlib at the top. Play the boot chime FIRST using a minimal
PCM player (just os + maix.audio), then do the heavy imports while the sound
is already playing. Net effect: boot chime plays ~4-6 seconds earlier.

To revert: move the "# ── Deferred imports" block back to the top of the file
(before main()), remove the _boot_cue_fast function, and uncomment the original
_boot_cues block. See RC_BLOCK_LEGACY in tools/run.py for the rc.local revert.

# ── Freeze forensics ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The camera/NPU teardown is a C call that holds the GIL. When it blocks in the
# cvitek VI driver the ENTIRE interpreter stops — no log line, no heartbeat, no
# traceback, and the audio already handed to the DMA loops one phrase forever.
# faulthandler's handler runs at the C level and walks the interpreter state
# directly, so `kill -USR1 <pid>` still prints every thread's Python stack while
# the GIL is held. It is the only way to see where a freeze actually happened.
# Costs nothing until the signal arrives.

def _boot_cue_fast():
    """Play 'AuralAI menyala' the instant we boot, with minimal imports.

    Three cases, in order:

    1. PCM exists AND /tmp/.boot_chime_played is set → aplay (from rc.local)
       already played the chime this boot. Skip, to avoid double-play.
       rc.local only sets the flag when the PCM file is present (see RC_BLOCK in
       tools/run.py), so a set flag reliably means "aplay had something to play".
       tools/run.py clears the flag on a manual relaunch, so an app restart
       (no reboot) still replays the cue.

    2. PCM exists, flag NOT set → play it directly via maix.audio.Player.
       Fast path: <0.5s vs ~2.3s for the full audio_manager route, and no
       config.py import (volume is read straight from /root/config.json).

    3. PCM missing (fresh flash, deleted cache, or re-recorded WAV) → FALLBACK:
       regenerate it from auralai_menyala.wav via play_wav_blocking(), which
       runs ffmpeg, caches the .pcm next to the WAV, and plays it. Slower and
       pulls in audio_manager, but only in this degraded case — and it is the
       ONLY path that recreates the PCM, so without it the cue would be silent
       forever once the cache is gone. The flag is ignored here because aplay
       cannot have played anything without the PCM.

    Any error → returns silently.
