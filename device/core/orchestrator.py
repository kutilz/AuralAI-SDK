"""
Orchestrator — Event-driven state machine & shared state hub.

Mode transitions
────────────────
  switch_mode(new_mode)   Thread-safe; releases resources from the old mode,
                          loads resources for the new one, plays a confirmation
                          audio cue. Can be called from any thread.

Hardware buttons
────────────────
  If cfg.BUTTON_PIN_MODE >= 0, a dedicated thread monitors that GPIO pin and
  cycles through modes on each falling edge (press). Configure the pin number
  in /root/config.json ("button_pin_mode": <N>). A second thread does the same
  for BUTTON_PIN_ACTION (describe / repeat).

  Holding BOTH together opens volume mode — see the volume section below.

Watchdog
────────
  The Orchestrator exposes self.watchdog so the AI Engine can send heartbeats.
  Set by main.py after creation via orch.watchdog = wd.

Thermal throttling
──────────────────
  HealthMonitor calls _on_thermal_throttle / _on_thermal_recover which adjust
  the effective camera FPS by writing to cfg at runtime.

    # Why a chord. All four gestures were already spoken for (short/long x
    # MODE/ACTION) and none was free to take: long-press MODE is the only way a
    # blind user rediscovers the web address after setup. A double-tap was the
    # other candidate, but it taxes the gestures that stay — every short press
    # would have to wait out the second-tap window before acting, making every
    # describe and every mode switch slower to pay for a setting people touch
    # once a week. Holding both buttons costs nothing that already works, and is
    # close to impossible to strike by accident.
    #
    # Inside the mode MODE steps down and ACTION steps up, matching the - / +
    # order the same two buttons sit in on the /buttons page. The confirmation
    # chime is played AT the new volume, so the user hears the setting itself
    # rather than a number they would have to turn into loudness in their head.
