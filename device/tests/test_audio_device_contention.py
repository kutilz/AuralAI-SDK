"""Two playback paths share one codec — neither may lose its clip to the other.

The MaixCAM codec accepts exactly one open `maix.audio.Player`. Two independent
paths open one: `play_wav_blocking` (the boot cues, which run before an
AudioManager exists) and `AudioManager._play_pcm_bytes` (the queue worker).
At boot they overlap — the "menghubungkan ke wifi" cue is still sounding when
the ready chime is queued — and the loser got

    RuntimeError: : Runtime error: failed to open PCM

which the caller swallowed into a text-only fallback. The observable damage:
on a device for blind users, "AuralAI siap digunakan" was never spoken.

Tested through the two public playback entry points against a codec fake that
enforces the real one-at-a-time rule, so the assertion is "the clip was heard",
not "a lock exists".
